# Natural-Language-Processing
Welcome to my Natural Language Processing (NLP) diary ^_^. 

## What are transformers?
* `Transformers` are a type of neural network architecture that allow for parallelization across the sequence. This means that the network can process all of the tokens in the sequence at the same time, rather than having to process them sequentially. This is a huge advantage over RNNs, which must process tokens sequentially.
* It was introduced through the paper [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) in 2017 which can be found in the Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017). by Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser and Illia Polosukhin
* Below is a diagram of the Transformer architecture:

)
* The Transformer architecture has been used in a variety of tasks, including machine
translation, text summarization, and image captioning.

### Future Work
1) Transformers & LLMs Applications
- This will focus on what 2017 NLP researchers have called "Transformer" models, which are a class of models that leverage the attention mechanism.
- These models are based on the Transformer architecture, which uses a stack of self-attention layers to draw global dependencies between input and output.
- The Transformer architecture is the basis for many of the most recent NLP models, including BERT, GPT-2, XLNet, and T5.
