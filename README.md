## Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

* The purpose of this project is to build a model that can predict the sentiment of a movie review.
* The dataset used is the [IMDB dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews) from Kaggle.
* The model is a Naive Bayes classifier that uses the [Bag of Words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) model to represent the text.
* The model is trained on 40,000 reviews and tested on 10,000 reviews.
* The model is then deployed using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
